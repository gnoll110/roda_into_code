# roda_intro_code
Roda framework intro code sample

To run the code on the home page of the [project's website][1].

## Install & run

```
> git clone https://github.com/gnoll110/roda_intro_code.git
> cd roda_intro_code
> bundle install
..................
> bundle exec rackup
```

Note: I had intended to add some rspec, 
but this can't be done until the main app class is refactored into a proper .rb file that can be required.
That wouldn't be the one file example that Jeremy intended for the project's home page.
